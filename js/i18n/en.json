  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_q1": "What are Intel’s 2030 sustainability goals in plain language?",
  "faq_a1": "In short: use cleaner energy, reduce emissions across operations and supply chain, conserve and restore water, and design products and processes for reuse and recycling. We publish progress in our annual sustainability reporting.",
  "faq_q2": "How do you measure progress toward these goals?",
  "faq_a2": "We track Scope 1–3 greenhouse gas emissions, energy mix, water use/restoration, waste and circularity metrics, and supplier engagement. Data follows the GHG Protocol and is reviewed by third parties.",
  "faq_q3": "Why did the page flip to right-to-left?",
  "faq_a3": "The site auto-detects the page language (e.g., Arabic or Hebrew) and switches to right-to-left for better readability. We also load Bootstrap’s RTL stylesheet and adjust layout so icons, alignment, and scrolling feel natural.",
